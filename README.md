Many battles have been fought during the World Wars. Even today there are several terrorist and insurgency attacks in many cities. Each battle generally has two armies (groups) facing each other. Lanchester had proposed a few models of combat and many battles of the World War 2 have followed those models. Here, we model a fictitious battle between two armies (which follow the combat rules) using cellular automata to look at the various possible outcomes. The rules for the cellular automata  will be decided within the scope of the imaginary battlefield that we create.

The folder contains the following things:

1) CellularAutomata-1v1 : This is the folder which contains the Matlab files for the first model of cellular automata. Referred to as Model 2(a) in the report. To run this simulation, open all the files in Matlab and run the test.m file. Wait until the simulation window pops up. 

2) CellularAutomata-2v2 : This is the folder which contains the Matlab files for the second model of cellular automata. Referred to as Model 2(b) in the report. To run this simulation, open all the files in Matlab and run the test.m file. Wait until the simulation window pops up.

3) DifferentialModel : This folder contains two python files. 

lanchester_C.py is the 1v1 differential model, referred as Model 1(a) in the report. To run this code open the python shell on your computer and write the name of the code. 

lan2.py is the 2v2 differential model, referred as Model 1(b) in the report. To run this code open the python shell on your computer and write the name of the code.

4) WarfareSimulation_Report_CS302 : is the report for the work done.
