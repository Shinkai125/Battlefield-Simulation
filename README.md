Many battles have been fought during the World Wars. Even today there are several terrorist and insurgency attacks in many cities. Each battle generally has two armies (groups) facing each other. Lanchester had proposed a few models of combat and many battles of the World War 2 have followed those models. Here, we model a fictitious battle between two armies (which follow the combat rules) using cellular automata to look at the various possible outcomes. The rules for the cellular automata  will be decided within the scope of the imaginary battlefield that we create.
